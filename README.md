# Cancer-Prediction-project
2.	Cancer Analysis

Primary Goal:    This project is to develop a ML model that can accurately predict the patient having cancer based, medical history, and test results. This will help healthcare to diagnose cancer at an early stage and provide  treatment 

Solution:   First collect a dataset of medical records and test results of patients who have been diagnosed with cancer. We will preprocess and clean the data, and transform the data into ML model also perform feature selection and feature engineering to identify the most important features that contribute to the prediction of cancer use algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests to determine which one performs best on the given dataset for evaluation metrics.

Result:       This helps healthcare professionals to diagnose cancer at an early stage and provide timely treatment to patients, leading to better patient outcomes with precision 88% , Accuracy >90%.
